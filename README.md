							Our research focuses on developing and analyzing high-resolution proxy records of past spatiotemporal climate and paleoenvironmental variability.  We use proxy system and climate models and a diverse set of statistical techniques in order to further refine and enhance our understanding of past, present, and future climate and environmental changes.  We specialize in dendroclimatology, multiproxy paleoclimatology, and climate field reconstructions.  <br /><br />You can learn more about all the members of our lab on the <a href="people.html" title="People">People</a> page. <br /><br /><br /><h5>Recent News</h5><br /><ul class="disc"><li>We have two new NSF-funded projects in the lab!  The first from NSF <a href="https://new.nsf.gov/funding/opportunities/paleo-perspectives-present-projected-climate" target="_blank">P4CLIMATE</a> will allow us to <a href="https://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=2303525&HistoricalAwards=false" target="_blank">study the behavior of the ITCZ over the last several centuries</a> using oxygen isotopes in tropical trees from both hemispheres in the Americas.

We find that while this drought was extremely severe, it falls within the range possible from natural climate variability. July through August deficits were the most significant drivers of overall drought, pointing to the importance of variability in the Midsummer Drought.  We also find that positive easterly zonal wind anomalies associated with the Caribbean Low-Level Jet are strongly linked to regional precipitation deficits. </li><li><a href="https://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/earth-sciences/people/ab276" target="_blank">Andrea Burke</a> leads <a href="https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.2221810120" target="_blank">a new paper in </a><em><a href="https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.2221810120" target="_blank">Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences </a></em>using sulfur isotope to quantify the stratospheric component.

Ellie Neifeld has a Bachelors in Earth and Oceanographic Science from Bowdoin College and will be working on high-latitude climate changes in North America for her Masters.  Ana Isabel Gonzalez Mendez has a Bachelors in Environmental Engineering from Universidad Rafael Landivar and then worked as the Coordinator for the Climate Change unit in Guatemala's Instituto Nacional de Sismolog&iacute;a, Vulcanolog&iacute;a, Meteorolog&iacute;a e Hidrolog&iacute;a.  Her Masters research will focus on climate variability and change in Central America.  Welcome! </li><li>Congratulations to Kira Harris, who successfully defended her Masters thesis on a late Holocene reconstruction of sea surface temperatures in the Gulf of California. Kira now moves onto the Ph.D. program here in the School of Geography, Development, and Environment! </li><li>Congratulations to <a href="https://jonking93.github.io/" target="_blank">Dr. Jonathan King</a>, who was awarded his Ph.D. in Geosciences in Spring 2022!  Jonathan's dissertation used data assimilation to investigate the climate of the Common Era.  He starts a <a href="https://www.usgs.gov/centers/mendenhall-research-fellowship-program" target="_blank">USGS Mendenhall postdoctoral fellowship </a>in Fall 2022 in Golden, Colorado! </li><li>Kevin has a new paper with Jason Smerdon providing a review of progress in reconstructing large-scale temperatures over the Common Era, identifying persistent and extant challenges for these reconstructions, and critiquing the IPCC for featuring a single reconstruction in the AR6 report and therefore not adequately representing what we know &mdash; and more importantly don't know &mdash; about the climate of the last 2000 years.  The paper is '<a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.quascirev.2022.107537" target="_blank">Progress and uncertainties in global and hemispheric temperature reconstructions of the Common Era</a>' is is open access. </li><li>Feng Zhu leads <a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-022-28210-1" target="_blank">a new paper where we re-evaluate the link between volcanic eruptions and ENSO</a>.  We find (1) only a weak statistical association between volcanism and ENSO and (2) that the selection of volcanic events in the analysis is a key variable to which the inference is highly sensitive.  We conclude that it is not possible to make any confident conclusions from the current last millennium paleoclimate record about the contribution of volcanic eruptions to ENSO dynamics. </li><li>Julie Edwards leads <a href="https://doi.org/10.1029/2021PA004386" target="_blank">a new paper investigating the erroneous cooling reconstructed from northern European trees during the 1783 eruption of Laki</a> in Iceland.  Using multiple lines of evidence, Julie shows this discrepancy is likely due to the direct impacts of acidic haze on trees. </li></ul>
